    Hi there! I'm Vimarsh(or Vim for short), a 3rd year PhD student at <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIUC</a>, advised by <a href="https://wsmoses.com/academic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Moses</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I am a researcher interested in the intersection of Automatic Differentiation(AD) and compiler optimizations, with a particular interest in optimizing higher-order AD computations. 
    Additionally, I'm also interested in the automated mapping of AD onto heterogeneous architectures like GPUs, without sacrificing on performance.

    Outside of academics, I like cardio(basically run + bike), and playing squash. I have also starting re-learning the piano, so there's that.
