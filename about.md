Hi there! I’m Vimarsh(or Vim for short), a 3nd year PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/). I work with [Billy Moses](https://wsmoses.com/academic/).

I’m currently working on GPU optimizations for sparse matrix/graph workloads, and abstractions for applying them in a generalized manner.

Outside of academics, I like running and playing squash. I have also starting re-learning the piano, so there’s that.
