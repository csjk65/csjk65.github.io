I have been getting into coffee recently. Thought I'd put up a list(and some comments) on interesting coffee shops I have visited so far. 

- **[Super Nice Coffee, 7th Ave, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Super+Nice+Coffee,+7th+Ave,+New+York)**

- **[Sey Coffee, BK, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Sey+Coffee,+Brooklyn,+New+York)**

- **[La Cabra, Soho, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/La+Cabra,+Soho,+New+York)**

- **[Dayglow, BK, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Dayglow,+Brooklyn,+New+York)**

- **[Do Not Feed Alligators, Bleecker St, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Do+Not+Feed+Alligators,+Bleecker+St,+New+York)**

- **[Qahwah House, W Village, New York](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Qahwah+House,+West+Village,+New+York)**

    Look, I know, it's tea and not coffee, but the Yemeni tea here is just amazing, so it deserves a mention. I didn't get a chance to go to the location in Williamsburg, but the Manhattan location was a stone's throw away from work.

- **[Dayglow, Chicago](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Dayglow,+Chicago)**
