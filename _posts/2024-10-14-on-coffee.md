I have been getting into coffee recently. Thought I'd put up a list(and some very opinionated comments) on interesting coffee shops I have visited so far. 

- **[Super Nice Coffee, 7th Ave, NYC](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vnC6WEoMScSuHXKA6)**

    This coffee shop location is *super* interesting, since the location is not just a coffee shop. Rather, a coffee shop, a flower shop and an omakase all share the same location! The coffee and flower shops are open in the morning, and the omakase opens at night.

    Shoutout to Riley and Ari for going along with my shenanigans with coffee there(especially wrt helping me figure out the ideal bean grind sizes for my Aeropress, and the proper ratio of chicory syrup to add in order to recreate the taste of South Indian Filter Coffee), and for Sameer to always stand by absolutely disgusted with the taste of espresso. 

- **[Sey Coffee, BK, NYC](https://www.seycoffee.com)**

    This place jumpstarted my journey on speciality coffee. It is a must visit. 

    Also I took a picture(it's an Aeropress brew, because yours truly went there *15 minutes before the shop closed*. It was still really fruity. I'd describe the outcome as caffienated happiness.)

- **[Do Not Feed Alligators, Bleecker St, NYC](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Do+Not+Feed+Alligators,+Bleecker+St,+New+York)**

- **[Qahwah House, W Village, NYC](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nqLp2ZWERfDaQmqA8)**

    Look, I know, it's tea and not coffee, but the Yemeni tea here is just amazing, so it deserves a mention. I didn't get a chance to go to the location in Williamsburg, but the Manhattan location was a stone's throw away from my internship location.
